# REPOSITORY

# INTRODUCTION

Example code to dump the configuration of a UM context, receiver, smart source, and regular source objects.

* bld.sh - build the test program.
* tst.sh - run the test program.

Both scripts expect a file "lbm.sh" that sets up your UM environment. See "lbm.sh.example" as a model.
